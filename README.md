The Towers of Hanoi is a game in which a stack of disks is moved from the first peg to a third peg with the help of an intermediate post.  Only one disk may be moved at one time and larger disks may never be on top of smaller disks.

The game was inspired by [`Math is Fun`](http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)

This project represents the culmination of the Algorithms/Recursion unit.

Levels of Achievement:
-----
  * C  : Use console to create an animation of recursive solution.  
  * A-: Use Allegro to create an animation of the recursive solution. Hard coding number of discs is OK.
  * A  : Use Allegro to create a clickable walk through of the recursive solution. User should be able to change number of discs (typical range is 5 - 7).
  * A+: Make the game also playable by the user.   
    * **All Levels Achieved**
